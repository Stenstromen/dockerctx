# DockerCTX

Rewrite of ahmetb's "kubectx" utility. [https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx)
<br>
To allow switching Docker Context

## Missing functionality compared to KubeCTX
### Rename Context
The docker context command does not allow context renaming, therefore this feature is omitted from DockerCTX.
### unset_context() func
The docker context command does not allow context unset, therefore this feature is omitted from DockerCTX.
